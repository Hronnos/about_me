# About me 

Graduated from the Belarusian State Academy of Communications. I have been working in the Ministry of Defense for distribution for a year. And when there was a year before the end of the contract, I began to study programming, already having knowledge of the full suite of Adobe programs. Initially I planned to go to the position of motion-design, but then I decided that there was enough gunpowder in me to become a programmer, and as you can see, gunpowder brought me to you :)

## Skills

## Courses and Education

Udemy, CodeAcademy, HtmlAcademy, Stepik, CS50 and Youtube videos.
